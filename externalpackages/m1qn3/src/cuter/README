The Makefile in this directory installs M1QN3 in the CUTEr environment.
This environment must have been installed before using the Makefile. See

   http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www/index.html

to have more information on CUTEr.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using the Makefile in this 'cuter' directory, you must define
a file in the 'm1qn3' directory (or a symbolic link to it), that
defines the compiler name and options, as well as other variables used
by Makefile. Before starting to work, the Makefile includes indeed the
file

   ../make.$PLAT
   
where $PLAT is en environment variable that identifies the platform and
must be set to some string. An example of such a make.$PLAT file is

   ../make.a_platform

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Makefile does the following tasks.

1) It generates the CUTEr scripts and specification file

    $MYCUTER/bin/m1qn3
    $MYCUTER/bin/sdm1qn3
    $(CUTER)/common/src/pkg/m1qn3/m1qn3.spc

This is actually realized by the Perl script ./make_sdm1qn3, which
follows the instructions given in section 1.10.1 of the CUTEr manual
(June 26, 2006).

2) It generates the object files

   ../bin/m1qn3.$PLAT.o
   ../bin/m1qn3ma.$PLAT.o
   
from the source codes

   ../src/m1qn3.f	(M1QN3 source code)
   ./m1qn3ma.f90	(CUTEr driver, using M1QN3)
   
respectively, in a version depending on a platform environment variable
$PLAT.


3) Next, it makes a symbolic link to the files

   ../bin/m1qn3.$PLAT.o
   ../bin/m1qn3ma.$PLAT.o
   
from the CUTEr directory

    $MYCUTER/double/bin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To realize these tasks, just enter

   make
