The Makefile in this directory installs the compiled version of m1qn3 in
the Libopt environment. This environment has been designed for testing,
comparing, and profiling solvers on problems belonging to heterogeneous
collections. To learn more on Libopt, see

   http://www-rocq.inria.fr/estime/modulopt/libopt/libopt.html

Libopt must have been installed before using this Makefile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

More precisely, the Makefile generates (if necessary) the object file

    ../bin/m1qn3.$LIBOPT_PLAT.o
    
from the source code

    ../src/m1qn3.f

in a version depending on the platform environment variable
$LIBOPT_PLAT. Next, it makes a symbolic link to it from the directory

    $LIBOPT_DIR/solvers/m1qn3/bin

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To realize this, just enter

   make
